# Postmortem: Outage Incident on Financial Portfolio Manager

**Issue Summary:**
- **Duration:** January 15, 2024, 2:00 PM — January 16, 2024, 4:00 AM (UTC)
- **Impact:** The Financial Portfolio Manager experienced intermittent service disruptions, resulting in slow response times. Approximately 15% of users were affected during this period.

## Timeline:

- **January 15, 2024, 2:15 PM (UTC):**
  - The issue was detected through monitoring alerts indicating a significant increase in response time.
  - The engineering team initiated an investigation, suspecting a potential bottleneck in the data processing component.

- **Misleading Investigation Path:**
  - Initially, the focus was on recent machine learning model updates that could have affected the data processing pipeline.
  - The incident was escalated to the data science team to assess the impact of the model updates.

- **January 16, 2024, 1:30 AM (UTC):**
  - Further investigation revealed that the root cause was not related to model updates but rather an overwhelmed database server.
  - The incident was escalated to the database administration team for immediate resolution.

- **January 16, 2024, 4:00 AM (UTC):**
  - The incident was resolved, and normal functionality was restored to the Financial Portfolio Manager.

## Root Cause and Resolution:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of the issue was an overwhelmed database server. The increased load on the system caused prolonged query execution times, leading to slow response times and intermittent service disruptions. The database server's capacity was not adequately scaled to handle the surge in user activity.

**Resolution:**
To resolve the issue, the database administration team scaled the database server's capacity, optimized query execution plans, and implemented query caching to improve response times. Additionally, they deployed enhanced monitoring to detect potential performance bottlenecks in real-time.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures:

**Improvements:**
1. **Optimize Database Scaling:**
   - Evaluate the current database infrastructure and determine if additional resources or distributed database solutions are required to handle peak loads.

2. **Enhance Monitoring and Alerts:**
   - Implement comprehensive monitoring across the entire system, including database performance, response times, and machine learning model inference times, to promptly identify any anomalies.

3. **Load Testing and Capacity Planning:**
   - Conduct regular load testing to simulate various usage scenarios and ensure the system can handle increased loads without degradation.

**Tasks to Address the Issue:**
1. **Scale Database Infrastructure:**
   - Assess the current database infrastructure’s capacity and explore options for scaling or introducing distributed database solutions.

2. **Implement Real-time Monitoring:**
   - Deploy a monitoring solution that covers database performance, response times, and machine learning model inference times, with appropriate alerts.

3. **Conduct Periodic Load Testing:**
   - Develop and execute load testing scenarios to validate the system’s performance under varying user activity levels.

By implementing these corrective and preventative measures, we aim to enhance the reliability and performance of the Financial Portfolio Manager, reducing the likelihood and impact of similar incidents in the future.
